‚òï Coffee Production and Price Analysis üìä

Welcome to the Coffee Production and Price Analysis project! This repository explores global coffee production trends, focusing on the top producers, their changing contributions over time, and the relationship between coffee production and pricing. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we provide visual insights to help better understand the coffee industry dynamics.

üìë Project Overview
1. üåç Coffee Production Stats
Objective: Visualize the top 10 coffee-producing countries by total production.
Visualization: A bar chart sorted from highest to lowest production, with x-axis labels showing two-letter country abbreviations.
2. ‚è≥ Top 5 Producers Over Time
Objective: Examine how coffee production has evolved for the top 5 nations over time.
Visualization: A line chart with a clear legend, plotting production trends. The time index is converted to datetime64[ns] for better accuracy.
3. üìà Composition Over Time
Objective: Analyze how Brazil's share of global coffee production has changed over time.
Visualization: Two plots‚Äîone showing global production, and another focusing on Brazil‚Äôs contribution across different time periods.
4. ü§ù Price Relationships
Objective: Compare Brazil's coffee production with key competitors, specifically Viet Nam and Venezuela.
Visualization: Scatter plots contrasting Brazil‚Äôs production with these two nations, highlighting potential relationships.
5. ü•ß Composition of Coffee Production
Objective: Illustrate the global coffee production landscape, focusing on the top 5 producers.
Visualization: A pie chart showcasing the top 5 coffee-producing countries, with a combined "Rest of the World" slice. Additionally, two donut charts compare Brazil's global share in 1990 vs. 2018.
6. üí∞ Coffee Production vs. Prices
Objective: Explore the relationship between coffee prices and consumption in key countries.
Visualization: A dual-axis bar chart, plotting coffee prices alongside consumption totals for selected nations to uncover any potential correlations.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib: For creating insightful visualizations.
